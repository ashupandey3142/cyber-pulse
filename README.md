# cyber-pulse
CyberPulse is a comprehensive security application designed to address the critical need for visibility into the usage and effectiveness of security tools within an organization. As security threats evolve, having a clear understanding of how tools are deployed and their impact on the overall security posture is paramount.

## Design Architecture

### Atomic Design Structure

This project follows the principles of Atomic Design, a methodology that helps in creating scalable and maintainable design systems. The components in this application are organized into atomic design elements:

- **Atoms:** Basic building blocks such as buttons, inputs, and labels.
- **Molecules:** Combinations of atoms that form more complex UI elements.
- **Organisms:** Groups of molecules functioning together as a unit.
- **Templates:** Higher-level structures that define the layout of pages.
- **Pages:** Specific instances of templates filled with real content.

This atomic design structure enhances the maintainability and scalability of the application by promoting reusability and consistency across components.

## Development Tools

### Storybook

We leverage [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to develop, document, and test our UI components in isolation. Storybook allows us to:

- **Isolate Components:** Develop and view components in isolation, making it easier to identify and fix issues.
- **Documentation:** Automatically generate documentation for each component, making it easy for developers to understand and use them.
- **Visual Testing:** Quickly test and iterate on components visually to ensure they meet design requirements.
- **Collaboration:** Facilitate collaboration between designers and developers by providing a shared platform for UI components.

### SonarCloud Setup

This project integrates [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) for code quality analysis. SonarCloud helps in maintaining code quality, identifying issues, and improving overall code health.

**Integration with SonarCloud:** Integrate project whoose [Code Quality Overview](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/overall?id=cyber-pulse_cyber) you can see here.

## Benefits of Atomic Design, Storybook, and SonarCloud

- **Modularity:** Atomic design promotes modular development, making it easier to manage and update individual components without affecting the entire application.

- **Consistency:** By using atomic design, we ensure a consistent look and feel across the application, enhancing the user experience.

- **Efficiency:** Storybook streamlines the development process by providing a dedicated environment for testing and refining components, leading to faster development cycles.

- **Documentation:** Storybook automatically generates documentation for each component, making it easier for developers to understand their usage and behavior.

- **Code Quality:** SonarCloud ensures that the codebase maintains high quality by identifying and highlighting issues, bugs, and security vulnerabilities.

- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly running SonarCloud analyses helps in continuous improvement, ensuring that the codebase stays healthy and maintainable.
